# Benchmark for comparing JSON performance on Java platform

This project contains benchmark suite for comparing performance of JSON-to/from-POJOs
data binding, using various Java JSON libraries.

## Basics

Libraries included are mostly ones that can do fully automatic data-binding; but in some
cases we also include ones that only implement Tree-based processing, in which case
additional manual coding is required. We may also include tree-based variants of
data-binding - capable libraries in cases where that makes sense. In all cases we
indicate processing-module uses (which indicates level-of-effort for using
library for data-binding use cases).
